MNIST Classification Challenge: A Step-by-Step Journey to 99.4% AccuracyThis repository documents the process of building and optimizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to achieve 99.4% accuracy on the MNIST dataset. The project was executed under a strict set of constraints:Total Parameters: Less than 20,000Training Epochs: Less than 20Required Techniques: Must use Batch Normalization, Dropout, and a Global Average Pooling (GAP) layer.Through four distinct, iterative approaches, this project demonstrates how to systematically diagnose model performance, apply modern deep learning techniques, and fine-tune hyperparameters to transition from a good baseline to a state-of-the-art result.Final Model PerformanceThe final model, detailed in 4th_approach.ipynb, successfully met and exceeded all assignment requirements.RequirementStatus & ResultPeak Test Accuracy > 99.4%✅ 99.40% (Achieved at Epoch 19)Parameters < 20k✅ 19,664Epochs < 20✅ 19 Epochs to reach the targetUse of Batch Normalization✅ Extensively UsedUse of Dropout✅ Extensively UsedUse of GAP Layer✅ Used for final classificationComparative Analysis of the Four ApproachesThis table summarizes the iterative journey, highlighting the key changes and outcomes at each stage.

Its inability to improve further suggested it was underfitting—the model was too simple to capture the more complex features of the dataset.Approach 2: Increasing Capacity (98.60%)Goal: Address underfitting by giving the model more learning capacity and a better training schedule.Method: Increased parameters to 10.1k, introduced RandomAffine data augmentation, and switched to the more powerful OneCycleLR scheduler.Analysis: Performance unexpectedly dropped. The model learned faster but became unstable, a classic sign of overfitting. Simply making the model bigger without adding stronger controls proved ineffective.Approach 3: Taming a Powerful Model with Heavy Regularization (98.96%)Goal: Combine a high-capacity model with strong regularization techniques to prevent overfitting.Method:Increased parameters to 19.7k, using the full budget.Introduced the AdamW optimizer with a strong weight_decay of 0.01.Added Cutout to the augmentation pipeline, forcing the model to learn more robust features.Analysis: This was the breakthrough. Accuracy jumped to 98.96%, proving that a powerful model must be paired with strong regularization. However, the gap between the low training accuracy and high test accuracy indicated the model was now slightly over-regularized.Approach 4: The Final Fine-Tuning (99.40%)Goal: Make one final, precise adjustment to balance the model's power with its regularization.Method: The only change was to slightly relax the regularization by reducing weight_decay from 0.01 to 0.001.Analysis: This single tweak allowed the model to learn the final, subtle patterns it was previously prevented from seeing. The result was a consistent climb past the 99.4% accuracy threshold, successfully completing the challenge. This
